chai-catch-exception
====================
 A ChaiJS Plugin inspired by catch-exception for Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mimiz/chai-catch-exception.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mimiz/chai-catch-exception)



## Usage :

The idea is to replace something like this :

    it("Should throw error when array contains a NaN, [1,'']", function(){

       expect(function(){ median([1,""]);}).to.throw(Error, "Must only contains numbers");

    });

OR the readable way ...

    it("Should throw error when array contains a NaN, [1,'']", function(){

        // We need to encapsulate the function call so it won't be evaluated
        var fn = function(){
            median([1, ""]);
        };

       expect(fn).to.throw(Error, "Must only contains numbers");

    });


With this :

    it("Should throw error when array contains a NaN, [1,'']", function(){

        expect(median).withParams([1,""]).to.throw(Error, "Must only contains numbers");

    });

which we find more readable !

## Todo

 * We still need to write tests with all assertion types : should, expect ...
 * Packages for npm and bower
